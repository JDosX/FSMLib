FSM -> C# Transpiler
====================

FSM -> C# transpiler, so you don't have to dynamically load and process the FSM each time you run the software
Will reduce performance foodprint on projects that don't need to have dynamically loaded FSMs



Provide the name of the final state in an FSM traversal
=======================================================

- When specifying whether the FSM accepted or rejected the input, also provide the name of the state, either as the
  return type or as an out variable, for example:
  
  bool Traverse(string input, out string finalState) -> where finalState is the final state the FSM landed on.
  
  							OR
  
  string Travsers(string input) -> where the result is "" if invalid, and the name of the string if a valid state.
