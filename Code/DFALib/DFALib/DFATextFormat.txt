Example of a DFA text format:

Name_Of_DFA:
   // + denotes initial state
   // * denotes accepting state
   // denotes line comment (this might cause a problem)
   // fnscript expressions automatically determine and assessed by understanding the type of DFA that was
   // created to read this state transition
   +State1 -> ["string transition" | State2]
	          [/regex transition/  | State3]
	          [FnScript Transition | State4]
  +*State2 -> etc....
